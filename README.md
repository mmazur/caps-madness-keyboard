# caps-madness-keyboard

You can use your capslock key as a replacement for your ctrl key.
Or you can use it for *everything*…

## Linux

You need:
* xorg
* xbindkeys

## Windows

You need:
* autohotkey
  * Note: seems to me like the virtual desktop switching functions are some old mangled version of https://github.com/pmb6tz/windows-desktop-switcher and could use a rebase
* sharpkeys

## Key binds

There's:
* A bunch of my random stuff
  * Like – all the keys on the bottom row that aren't Space or Ctrl are now Alt_L, because [I use alt for everything in Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-management-shortcuts/gpjllhokdlfhkinemgcogaehafejepnm)
  * Or – some key bindings assume this is a Polish keyboard, so _w Szczebrzeszynie zażółć gęślą jaźń_
* caps+1…5 – switch between virtual desktops 1…5
* caps+q…t – switch between virtual desktops 6…10
* caps+d – hide/show desktop
* caps+hjkl – left/down/up/right arrow
* caps+i – Del
* caps+0 – Home
* caps+; – End
* caps+f – open console
* caps+p – open browser
